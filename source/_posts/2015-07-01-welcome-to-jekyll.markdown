# **This doesn't look right, does it?**

## That's because materialize.css doesn't load properly when you click on a blog post.

To fix this, edit your site.url and site.baseurl properties and change the url to the css in the default.html layout to use these new properties.
Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
